# GlobeTalk ‚Äî Virtual Pen Pals üåç‚úâÔ∏è

**GlobeTalk** is a privacy-first, anonymous pen-pal platform that connects people around the world for friendly, cultural, asynchronous ‚Äúletter‚Äù exchanges. It recreates the charm of postal pen pals using modern web tech: random matchmaking, delayed message delivery, short cultural profiles, and moderation ‚Äî text-only and anonymous by design.

# Quick summary
- **Purpose:** Help users make anonymous, cross-cultural connections via delayed text letters.  
- **Key constraints:** Text-only (no file/media), anonymous (no names/emails published), moderation/reporting, OAuth-based sign-in for account protection.  
- **Target users:** Curious learners, language learners, students, and anyone seeking low-pressure cultural exchange.

# Features
- **Random Matchmaking** ‚Äî pair users globally with optional filters (language, region/time-zone).  
- **Asynchronous Messaging** ‚Äî write a ‚Äúletter‚Äù, schedule a delivery delay (e.g., 12 hours).  
- **Cultural Profiles** ‚Äî short, anonymous fields (age range, hobbies, region, languages).  
- **Inbox / Compose** ‚Äî thread-based UI for reading and writing letters.  
- **Moderation** ‚Äî reporting, moderation logs, blocking.  
- **Settings & Safety** ‚Äî block/report, toggle match preferences, delete account.

# Security audit (supply chain)

We ship a tiny audit that checks your dependency graph against known-compromised npm releases (from recent Debug/Chalk and Tinycolor campaigns). Reports are written under `security/`.

Run with Node (recommended):

```powershell
# root app
node scripts/security/scan-compromised.js security/compromised.json

# server package
Set-Location 'server'; node ../scripts/security/scan-compromised.js ../security/compromised.json; Set-Location '..'
```

Run with Python (alternative):

```powershell
# root app
python scripts/security/scan_compromised.py --root . --compromised security/compromised.json --out security/compromised-report-python.md

# server package
Set-Location 'server'; python ../scripts/security/scan_compromised.py --root . --compromised ../security/compromised.json --out security/compromised-report-python.md; Set-Location '..'
```

Outputs
- Root (Node): `security/compromised-report.md`
- Server (Node): `server/security/compromised-report.md`
- Root (Python): `security/compromised-report-python.md`
- Server (Python): `server/security/compromised-report-python.md`

To update the list of bad packages/versions, edit `security/compromised.json` and re-run the audit.

# Sprint 2 Deliverables (Rubric-aligned)

Status: planning/implementation. This sprint focuses on matchmaking, richer profiles, edit flows, CI coverage, and a deployable backend on Railway.

- [ ] Matchmaking functionality
  - Acceptance: Users can request a match and optionally filter by language and/or time zone. Visible in UI (Matchmaking page) with loading/error states, and a ‚Äúproceed to chat‚Äù handoff.
  - Backend: HTTP endpoint for match requests (e.g., `GET /api/match?timezone=&language=`) and data fetchers for languages/timezones.
  - Pointers:
    - Frontend components under `src/app/pages/matchmaking/`.
    - Backend service under `server/` (Express/Firebase Admin).

- [ ] Edit profile
  - Acceptance: An ‚ÄúEdit Profile‚Äù form that lets a signed-in user update profile fields and persists to backend.
  - Client validation and helpful error messages; success toast; disabled save while submitting.
  - Pointers: `src/app/pages/userprofile/` or `src/app/pages/profile/` and server endpoints under `server/`.

- [ ] More significant profile details
  - Acceptance: Store and render richer fields beyond MVP, e.g., `timezone`, `languages` (codes + names), `favorites`, `funFacts`, `sayings`, `country`, `username`, `avatarUrl`.

- [ ] Testing coverage ‚â• 40%
  - Acceptance: `npm run test -- --coverage` shows overall lines coverage ‚â• 40% in CI; critical flows (matchmaking and profile edit) have happy-path tests and at least one

- [ ] Functional backend server setup on Railway
  - Acceptance: Server starts on Railway and serves API endpoints (profiles, matchmaking, lookups). Health check route responds 200.
  - Suggested steps (high level):
    1) Create a Railway project and attach this repo‚Äôs `server/` folder as a service.
    2) Set environment variables (e.g., Firebase Admin creds, CORS origins) in Railway.
    3) Configure start command (e.g., `node index.js`) and a `PORT` binding.
    4) Verify via Railway deployment logs and `GET /health`.
  - Note: Keep secrets in Railway variables; do not commit them.

# Sprint 3 Deliverables (Rubric-aligned)

Focus: end-to-end messaging polish, moderation workflows, safety features, personal stats, and CI hardening.

- [ ] Asynchronous messaging & delivery engine
  - Acceptance: Letters remain locked until their delivery time; users see accurate unlock times even after refresh. Delivered messages are readable and appear in order. Back end either filters by deliveryTime or a lightweight scheduler flips a delivered flag.
  - Pointers:
    - Client: `src/app/pages/inbox/page.js` (deliveryTime, lock/unlock rendering)
    - Server: `server/index.js` (`POST /api/chat/send`, consider a cron/worker or time-based filtering)

- [ ] Inbox export & UX improvements
  - Acceptance: Users can download a single letter and the full chat transcript as PDF. Export includes timestamps and sender labels. Composer enforces max length and shows remaining characters.
  - Pointers: Implement `handleDownloadChatPDF` and validate with Jest by mocking jsPDF.

- [ ] Moderation dashboard & actions (admin)
  - Acceptance: Reports page lists incoming reports, shows severity tags, and allows validate/invalidate actions that persist status via API. Polling or on-demand refresh shows updates.
  - Pointers: UI `src/app/pages/reports/page.js`; API `POST /api/reports/:id/validate|invalidate`, `GET /api/reports`.

- [ ] Blocking & safety controls
  - Acceptance: A user can block another user. Blocked users won‚Äôt appear in matchmaking and cannot send new messages. Provide unblock controls.
  - Backend: `POST /api/block` (blockUid), `DELETE /api/block` (unblock), `GET /api/blocked` (list). Client filters matches and hides chats from blocked users.

- [ ] Account management (delete + data export)
  - Acceptance: User can request a data export (JSON download of profile, matches, and messages) and can delete their account. Deletion removes profile and chat references server-side.
  - Backend: `GET /api/export/:uid`, `DELETE /api/users/:uid`.

- [ ] Personal stats dashboard
  - Acceptance: A dashboard visualizes key metrics (total letters, active pen pals, countries connected, average response time, recent activity). Tests verify formatting and empty states.
  - Pointers: API `GET /api/stats`; UI under `src/app/pages/dashboard/`.

- [ ] Explore quiz finalized
  - Acceptance: Country quiz runs end-to-end with scoring and results summary, and the user can retake. Basic unit tests cover scoring logic.
  - Pointers: `src/app/pages/explore/page.js` and `src/app/pages/explore/data.js`.

- [ ] i18n/timezone data availability
  - Acceptance: Available languages/timezones endpoints return non-empty datasets in a fresh DB by seeding from `public/assets/`. UI fallbacks still work if DB is empty.
  - Backend seeding script or on-demand import on first request.

- [ ] CI/CD hardening and quality gates
  - Acceptance: Test coverage ‚â• 60% enforced via Jest thresholds and Codecov status check. Supply-chain audit runs in CI using `scripts/security/scan-compromised.js` and fails on findings.
  - Extras: Basic Express rate limiting and CORS origin allow-list on the server.
